# Assignment: Simple Calculator GUI Application
## Objective:
Create a simple calculator GUI application using Java that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This application should allow the user to input two numbers and select an operation to perform. Upon performing the operation, the result should be displayed on the interface.

## Requirements:
1. User Interface:
    - Use JFrame to create the main window of your application.
    - Include two text fields for the input of numbers.
    - Provide four buttons, each representing one of the basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
    - Display the result in a label or a disabled text field when an operation is performed.

2. Functionality:

    - Implement action listeners for the operation buttons. When an operation button is clicked, the application should read the input from the two text fields, perform the selected operation, and display the result.
    - Ensure your application handles division by zero by displaying an appropriate error message in the result field.

3. Error Handling:

    - Validate the input to ensure that only numeric values are entered.
    - Display an error message if non-numeric values are entered.

4. Styling (Optional):
   - If time permits, students are encouraged to explore different ways to style the GUI components for a better user experience.
